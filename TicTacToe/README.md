# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game played against an AI agent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features
- **Unbeatable AI**: Uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure the AI never loses.
- **Interactive Console**: Simple text-based interface for playing the game.
- **Smart Moves**: The AI calculates the optimal move to win or force a draw.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `TicTacToe` directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
   ```

## How to Play
- You play as **X** (or choose to go second as O).
- Enter a number from **1 to 9** to place your mark on the board.
- The positions correspond to the keypad layout:
  ```
  1 | 2 | 3
  4 | 5 | 6
  7 | 8 | 9
  ```

## Algorithm
The AI uses **Minimax**, a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. It evaluates all possible future moves to determine the best path to victory (or to avoid defeat).
